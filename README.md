# isthisska_bot
Bot powering twitter.com/isthisska_bot

Powers https://twitter.com/isthisska_bot tweets. Tweets out random album art and asks if that's what ska is.

Needs some API token files in order to work, but otherwise what's here is what's running there.

Assumes you have https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php running on your system, to shrink images if they're too big to
tweet.

Powered by the MusicBrainz API https://musicbrainz.org/doc/Development/XML_Web_Service/Version_2 and the joint MusicBrainz/Internet Archive Cover Art Archive https://wiki.musicbrainz.org/Cover_Art_Archive/API.

Produced by Andrew Michaud for #NaBoMaMo 2016.
